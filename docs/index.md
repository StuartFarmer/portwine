Portwine is a clean, elegant portfolio backtester that makes strategy development and testing simple and intuitive.

## What is Portwine?

Portfolio construction, optimization, and backtesting can be a complicated web of data wrangling, signal generation, lookahead bias reduction, and parameter tuning.

But with `portwine`, strategies are clear and written in an 'online' fashion that removes most of the complexity that comes with backtesting, analyzing, and deploying your trading strategies.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Simple Strategies
Strategies are only given the last day of prices to make their determinations and allocate weights. This allows them to be completely encapsulated and portable.

### âš¡ Breezy Backtesting
Backtesting strategies is a breeze. Simply tell the backtester where your data is located with a data loader manager and give it a strategy. You get results immediately.

### ðŸ“Š Streamlined Data
Managing data can be a massive pain. But as long as you have your daily flat files from EODHD or Polygon saved in a directory, the data loaders will manage the rest.

### ðŸ“ˆ Effortless Analysis
After running a strategy through the backtester, put it through an array of analyzers that are simple, visual, and clear.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install portwine
```

```python
from portwine import SimpleMomentumStrategy, Backtester, EODHDMarketDataLoader

# Define your universe
universe = ['MTUM', 'VTV', 'VUG', 'IJR', 'MDY']

# Create a strategy
strategy = SimpleMomentumStrategy(tickers=universe, lookback_days=10)

# Set up data and backtester
data_loader = EODHDMarketDataLoader(data_path='path/to/your/data/')
backtester = Backtester(market_data_loader=data_loader)

# Run backtest
results = backtester.run_backtest(strategy, benchmark_ticker='SPY')
```
